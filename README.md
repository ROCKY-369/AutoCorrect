## **Product Description** ##

Evaluating descriptive answers takes a long time and requires a lot of physical effort. It is prone to grader fatigue, partiality, and inconsistency caused by differing standards.  We have developed a solution to address the above mentioned concerns. Our automated grading system uses strong NLP and machine learning algorithms to deliver consistent grades for descriptive responses.

AutoCorrect+ uses a few natural language processing (NLP) packages and techniques to accurately assess descriptive answers. It employs NLTK for breaking text into smaller units (tokenization) and removing commonly used words (stop word removal). In addition to that, it also uses the scikit-learn (sklearn) package to calculate text similarity using methods like cosine similarity and Jaccard distance. By combining these NLP approaches, AutoCorrect+ establishes a solid foundation for evaluating descriptive answers effectively.

Moreover, AutoCorrect+ is integrated with the Django framework, which provides a user-friendly interfaces for both administrators and students. Administrators can login and manage user registrations, analyze exam results, and add or modify courses and questions through the interface. Similarly, students can easily register, log in, attempt exams, view their results, and update their profiles using the provided interface.

The aim of AutoCorrect+ is to enhance traditional manual grading methods by introducing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability to educational assessment systems using  NLP techniques and user-friendly interfaces.
